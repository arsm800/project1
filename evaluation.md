# Project Evaluation

See below for my project evaluation. Feel free to hit me up via Slack or GitHub with additional questions and comments!

## Project Workflow

> Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?  

**Exceeds Expectations:** You'd be surprised to find out how many people do not put time into a good informative readme. I was able to learn a lot not only about your application but also the thought process that went behind its creation just by looking at the readme. Great job. If you'd like to take this to the next level, look into how you can use write [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) to make the readme pretty.

## Technical Requirements

> Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?  

**Meets Expectations:** Good job here - you checked of all the bullet points under `Technical Requirements`. There are a number of opportunities for refactoring (e.g., consolidating repeated code into functions), so definitely keep an eye out for those next time you give this project a look. I also left some notes about lingering bugs (e.g., you can click the same tile twice to get a "match") in my inline comments.

## Code Quality

> Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?  

**Meets Expectations**: Code readability was solid. I would run through your Javascript and make sure indentation is uniform throughout. Also make sure to get rid of commented-out code before submitting a project. If you'd really like to keep it, consider storing it in a branch separate from `master` or `gh-pages`.

In the future, you should also create your own repo for a project and work on that. No need to fork the GA project repo.

Make sure to take a look at the inline code comments I made in this pull request.
